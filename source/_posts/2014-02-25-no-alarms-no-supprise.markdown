A heart that’s full up like a landfill

A job that slowly kills you

Bruises that won’t heal

You look so tired and unhappy

Bring down the government

They don’t, they don’t speak for us  

I’ll take a quiet life

A handshake of carbon monoxide

No alarms and no surprises

Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises

Such a pretty house, such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
